# HotText_App
Automate statements, and commands with hotkeys. You will need to install Python3.9, the keyboard module, and VSCode. VsCode and Python3.9 can be installed form the Microsoft Store.

## HotKeys
As it is coded now you must hit the corresponding number with the hotkeys `ctrl+alt` to activate the statements. Example: `ctrl+alt+2`.

## HotTalk
HotTalk.py is the main script. The needed pip module to import to your computer is: `pip install keyboard`. Type this into PowerShell after Python3 is installed.
