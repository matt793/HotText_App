We currently have a limited number of AutoCAD, Revit, and Navisworks licenses. If you receive an error message regarding the license when launching the program, this means that all available licenses are currently in use. Please try launching to program again in 10 minutes to see if a license has been made available for you to use. If not, you may need to reach out to another employee who may have the program open but is currently not using it so that they can close it to free up a license. If you are only viewing a model, we highly suggest using the Autodesk viewers that are installed on your computer. These programs are DWG TrueView (For AutoCAD/Civil 3D Models) and Navisworks Freedom Viewer (For Navisworks Models). Should you have questions or concerns please contact your district's VDC Manager for more information.
